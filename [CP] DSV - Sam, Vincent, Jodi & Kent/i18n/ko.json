Not because I grow tired of writing but because this is my last page.^I've returned from war - Gotoro and its former territory have been at it for a while now, and I heard the call to fight against my own motherland for what I believe is right.^I left unwillingly; the military could no longer use me to their benefit, so I am being sent back. I have no home in Ferngill, but luckily I have savings in a bank. I plan to buy a piece of land somewhere. Somewhere small and peaceful.^I hope to raise a farm, though I only have one arm now. I'm sure it'll be a difficult task. But I am hopeful for it.^I just want to rest now.^-Lyell Halkias",
